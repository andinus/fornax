This collection includes:
• `fornax': Program that parses /Fornax Format/ and outputs video
  solution.
• Algorithms: Various algorithms solved in several programming
  languages.


1 Documentation
═══════════════

  Fornax parses /Fornax format/, generates a `PNG' for each iteration
  which is later converted to a slideshow with `ffmpeg'.

  • Solved paths are highlighted if the iteration is preceded by `|'.
  • Illegal paths are highlighted if the iteration is preceded by `!'.


2 Fornax Format
═══════════════

  Fornax format is an intermediate output file generated after solving
  the maze. Algorithms must output the solution in this format.

  ┌────
  │ rows:<number of rows> cols:<number of columns>
  │
  │ ...iterations
  └────

  `...iterations' is to be replaced by the resulting grid in each
  iteration that is to be included in the final video. Since the number
  of rows and columns is known, the whole grid should be printed in a
  single line.

  • Every iteration should be separated by a newline.

  • If the iteration cells is not equal to `rows * columns' or `(rows *
      columns) + 1' then it may be ignored by the program that parses
      the file.

  • Solved iteration can be preceded by `|' character.

  • Iteration that tries to walk on a blocked path can be preceded by
    `!' character.


2.1 Grids
─────────

  A grid is printed for every iteration. Grids are composed of cells.

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Cell              Symbol
  ──────────────────────────
   Path              `.'
   Blocked           `#'
   Destination       `$'
  ──────────────────────────
   Visited           `-'
   Current Position  `@'
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  • /Current Position/ is prioritized over /Blocked/ & /Destination/
    symbol if it makes sense.


3 Project Structure
═══════════════════

  • Algorithms are located in `algorithms/' directory, sub-directory
    needs to be created for programming languages which will hold the
    actual source.
